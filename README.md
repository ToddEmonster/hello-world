# hello-world
My first repository, yay ! Hello, GitHub world !

Time to write some changes here. 
Currently I'm getting more and more desperate about the whole conda bug. I have no idea whatsoever about what are proxies, parsing, and why this proxy/URL parsing error keeps showing and preventing me from updating spyder and installing Geopandas.

But I still love Python. Just, not Anaconda. I feel there is much I still have to learn to begin to understand what I'm doing.

I would like to mention abyss tacos because they don't get as much credits as they should.
